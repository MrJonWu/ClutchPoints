##Installation

Install these if you don't have them already: 
-Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
-Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-tab)
-Webpack (globally) (https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/#global-installation)

You will need to create or copy a 'config.json' file into the /config with the sports radar api key.

Then run the following from the root directory:

- yarn install
- yarn build
- yarn start

Once the node server is running and the webpack build has finished bundling, check out http://localhost:1337 to see the app in action!
